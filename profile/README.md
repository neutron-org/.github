## What is Neutron?
Neutron is the [Integrated Application](https://blog.neutron.org/neutron-the-integrated-application-network-2944b2e2cade) Network. 
By granting contracts the power of an appchain, Neutron enables developers to build breakthrough applications and onboard users from anywhere.

Neutron provides advanced cross-chain functionality that enables smart contracts to [execute and track transactions on remote blockchains](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/overview), trigger callbacks, and [retrieve data trustlessly over IBC](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/overview). Neutron's enshrined infrastructure provides developers access to enshrined oracle and [orderbook](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/dex/overview/) infrastructure, as well as access to consensus votes, [native automation](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/cron/overview), [custom fee markets and MEV recapture](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/3rdparty/skip/block-sdk/overview). 

Neutron is a permissionless smart contract platform built with [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/), [CosmWasm](https://book.cosmwasm.com/) and the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/). CosmWasm smart contracts are written in Rust, which prevents the main attack vectors used against Solidity/EVM dApps. Neutron is one of the first networks to be secured by restaking through Replicated Security, ensuring dApps are always safeguarded by billions of dollars of economic security.
