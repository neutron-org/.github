## What is Neutron?
Neutron is a public PoS blockchain network that lets BTC holders earn sustainable BTC yield on their assets through an expanding suite of products and services. Yield opportunities on Neutron are enabled by Neutronâ€™s built-in infrastructure, which includes its high-frequency oracle, cron module, hybrid orderbook DEX, and more. As demand for BTC yield on Neutron increases, NTRN stakers capture the value of the network in transaction fees and a reduced supply of NTRN tokens.
